        "hint": "Is there any difference in color or taste between the active drug and the placebo?",
        "explanation": "Even if patients swallow the pill whole, they might still get some idea of its taste. If the real medication is somewhat bitter, this could be a tip-off. Additionally, medical staff observing a patient’s reaction (e.g., making a sour face) during the first dose could become un-blinded, potentially affecting the assessment of outcomes."

        "hint": "Are there any side effects associated with the drug or treatment?",
        "explanation": "Active drugs are more likely to produce real side effects compared to placebos. For blood pressure medications, classic side effects include “lightheadedness upon standing” (postural hypotension) and increased urination (common for diuretics). Encourage students to consult with experts to explore specific classes of side effects relevant to their case study."

        "hint": "Have you considered using an “active placebo” for drugs with noticeable side effects?",
        "explanation": "Investigators sometimes use an agent as a control that mimics the side effects of the active drug but doesn’t produce the intended drug effect. This concept is more common for drugs with noticeable side effects (like flushing or dry mouth)."
